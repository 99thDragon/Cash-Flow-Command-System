FINAL SCOPED SOLUTION
"Cash Flow Command System" - Tracks the 3 critical workflows that make or break small business cash flow while documenting processes
________________


WHAT I'M BUILDING:
Three Core Workflows:
1. Sale → Invoice → Payment (Accounts Receivable)
* Track invoice status (sent, viewed, paid, overdue)
* Automated payment reminders (3, 7, 14 days)
* Aging report (current, 30, 60, 90+ days)
* Customer payment patterns
2. Purchase → Bill → Payment (Accounts Payable)
* Track bills due
* Payment schedule planning
* Vendor payment tracking
* Cash outflow forecast
3. Cash Position → Decision Making
* Current cash balance
* 4-week rolling forecast (in vs. out)
* Runway calculator ("weeks until $0")
* "Can we afford X?" decision tool
________________


FEATURES I WILL BUILD:
Dashboard View:
✅ Current cash position (today's number) ✅ Money coming in next 30 days (AR) ✅ Money going out next 30 days (AP) ✅ Net cash forecast by week (4 weeks) ✅ Alert flags (overdue invoices, bills due soon, low runway)
Accounts Receivable Module:
✅ Invoice list with status ✅ Days outstanding for each invoice ✅ Auto-reminder email templates ✅ "Send reminder" button ✅ Payment received logging
Accounts Payable Module:
✅ Bill list with due dates ✅ Payment priority ranking ✅ "Schedule payment" function ✅ Vendor payment history
Process Documentation (Built-In):
✅ Step-by-step workflow for each process ✅ Checklist format embedded in tool ✅ "How to" guide for team members ✅ Responsibility assignments (who does what)
________________


FEATURES I WILL NOT BUILD:
❌ Accounting software integration (manual input for now) ❌ Mobile app ❌ Multi-user permissions/roles ❌ Reporting/analytics beyond basic dashboard ❌ Customer portal ❌ Payment processing integration ❌ Inventory tracking ❌ Payroll management ❌ Tax calculations ❌ Historical data analysis (focus on forward-looking)

3-SESSION BUILD PLAN:
Session 1: Structure + AR Workflow (3 hours)
Hour 1: Setup + Design
* Choose platform (Google Sheets + Apps Script OR Airtable)
* Create database structure (invoices, bills, cash entries)
* Design dashboard layout
Hour 2: Build AR Tracker
* Invoice entry form
* Status tracking (sent/paid/overdue)
* Aging calculation (days outstanding)
* Basic aging report view
Hour 3: Document AR Process
* Write step-by-step invoice-to-payment workflow
* Create reminder email templates
* Build "when to follow up" checklist
* Embed process into tool (help text/instructions)
Deliverable: Working AR tracker with process documented
________________


Session 2: AP Workflow + Cash Dashboard (3 hours)
Hour 1: Build AP Tracker
* Bill entry form
* Due date tracking
* Payment schedule view
* "Bills due this week" alert
Hour 2: Cash Position Dashboard
* Current cash balance entry
* Calculate total AR (money coming in)
* Calculate total AP (money going out)
* Net position calculation
* 4-week forecast view
Hour 3: Document AP Process
* Write bill-to-payment workflow
* Create payment prioritization rules
* Build "when to pay" decision tree
* Embed in tool
Deliverable: Complete cash visibility system with both workflows
________________


Session 3: Automation + Polish (3 hours)
Hour 1: Build Automation
* Automated reminder emails (using Apps Script or Zapier)
* Due date alerts
* Low cash runway warnings
* Weekly summary email
Hour 2: Create Decision Tool
* "Can we afford X?" calculator
* Scenario modeling (what if we spend $Y?)
* Impact on runway calculation
* Quick reference guide
Hour 3: Training + Launch
* Create user guide
* Train on data entry
* Set up weekly review rhythm
* First live data entry session
* Establish maintenance process (who updates when)
Deliverable: Fully functional system ready for daily use

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
Option A: Google Sheets + Apps Script (Recommended)
Pros: Free, familiar, easy to customize, no learning curve Cons: Less polished UI, manual updates needed
Option B: Airtable
Pros: Better UI, forms built-in, easier automation Cons: $20/month cost, learning curve
Recommendation: Start with Google Sheets - can migrate to Airtable later if needed
________________


DATA REQUIREMENTS (Minimal):
To Track:
* Invoice #, customer name, amount, date sent, due date, status
* Bill #, vendor name, amount, due date, status
* Current cash balance
* That's it - keep it simple
Update Frequency:
* AR: Daily (when invoices sent/payments received)
* AP: Weekly (when bills come in)
* Cash balance: Daily (or weekly minimum)
* Forecast: Updates automatically based on AR/AP
________________


SUCCESS METRICS:
Week 1:
* All current invoices entered
* All current bills entered
* First cash forecast generated
* Team trained on basic use
Week 4:
* AR collection time reduced by 7 days
* Zero "surprise" cash crunches
* 100% bills paid on time (no late fees)
* Accurate 4-week cash forecast
Week 12:
* AR collection time reduced by 15 days
* Cash runway always visible
* Documented processes followed 90% of time
* New team members can use system independently

PROCESS DOCUMENTATION EMBEDDED:
Each module includes:
AR Process Checklist:
1. Create invoice same day as sale
2. Send invoice within 24 hours
3. Log in tracker immediately
4. Set reminder for day 3
5. Follow up at 3, 7, 14 days if unpaid
6. Escalate at 30 days
AP Process Checklist:
1. Enter bill in tracker when received
2. Verify against PO/receipt
3. Schedule payment for 3 days before due
4. Check cash position before scheduling
5. Mark paid and log date
Cash Decision Process:
1. Check current cash balance
2. Review forecast (next 4 weeks)
3. Calculate impact of expense
4. Check runway after expense
5. Decide: Yes (runway >4 weeks) / Maybe (2-4 weeks) / No (<2 weeks)
